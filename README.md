# CLICalc

This is a C# expression evaluator (**including unit tests**) which can evaluate the following expression:

- 1 + 2
- 3 * 4
- 11 - 2
- 2 * 3 – 1
-  6 – 2 * 5

The tokens are separated with a space.
Only the 3 operators have to be implemented: plus (+), minus (-) and multiply (*)
The code is extensible if we need to add a new operator like divide (/)
The expression handle only integers (no floating decimal).
